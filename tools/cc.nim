# tools/cc.nim — cyclomatic complexity, measured on the real AST.
#
# WHY NOT A REGEX. tools/complexity.py counts `if|elif|while|and|or|except` as
# text. That is wrong in both directions, and both were observed here:
#
#   OVERCOUNTS  the words inside STRING LITERALS. A three-arm case in
#               compiler/diagnostics.nim scored 8 — every match was inside
#               quotes, including an `if n > 0:` in an explanation. Splitting
#               such a proc cannot lower its score, so the gate was asking for
#               a refactor that did not exist.
#
#   UNDERCOUNTS `case` arms, which are the branches Nim code actually uses.
#               A 20-arm case over an enum counted as 1.
#
# Both disappear when the measurement is the parse tree. The Nim compiler is
# available as a library, so this parses the file for real and walks it.
#
# THE METRIC. McCabe: complexity = decision points + 1. A decision point is
# anything that adds an edge to the control-flow graph:
#
#   if / elif        each condition
#   case             each `of` arm, and each `elif` inside one
#   while / for      the loop test
#   and / or         short-circuit — a second path around the right operand
#   except           each handler
#
# NOT counted: `else` (the edge already exists), `try`/`finally` (no branch of
# their own), and anything inside a nested routine — that gets its own score.
#
# BUILD ONCE (the binary is gitignored; this imports Nim's compiler sources,
# so it needs the install root on the path):
#
#   nim c --path:$(dirname $(dirname $(readlink -f $(command -v nim)))) \
#       -o:tools/cc tools/cc.nim

  # --debt / --heavy: the metrics that actually track "small, readable procs".
  #
  # WHY THE COUNT ALONE IS THE WRONG GATE. `--budget` counts ROUTINES over 5
  # and weights them all the same, so a cc=6 helper (one guard plus a short
  # case) is the same unit of debt as a cc=53 monster. Two consequences, both
  # observed in this tree:
  #
  #   * it fires on good code. 64 procs sit at exactly cc=6, one over the
  #     line, and almost all are fine.
  #   * it PUNISHES the fix. Splitting genType (cc=53, worst in the tree) into
  #     three readable procs raised the count by two, because three procs over
  #     5 score worse than one at 53. The gate rewarded leaving it alone.
  #
  # DEBT sums how far each routine is over 5, so splitting a monster always
  # helps (53 becomes 8+7+6: debt 48 -> 6) and a new cc=6 helper costs 1.
  # HEAVY counts only routines at or over its threshold — the ones where
  # complexity genuinely hurts reading. Together they say "the tail is
  # shrinking" without taxing every small helper.
